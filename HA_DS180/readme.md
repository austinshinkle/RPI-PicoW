# Software Setup for RPI Pico W

## 1. Download Micropython firmware to RPI Pico W
Put the device into BOOT mode and copy the correct UF2 file (named something like RPI_PICO_W-20241025-v1.24.0.uf2) onto the system. If this is a new RPI Pico W, it will automatically start in BOOT mode. Additional instructions can be found on the official Raspberry Pi website <https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html#drag-and-drop-micropython>

## 2. Install the umqtt.simple micropython library
From Thonny, go to "Tools...Manage packages...", search for "micropython-umqtt.simple" and install it

## 3. Copy main.py onto the target
From Thonny, go to "File...Save as...", select the Raspberry Pi Pico and save the file to the main folder

# Additional Notes

## Home Assistant Setup
The configuratin.yaml file in Home Assistant must be updated to connect the MQTT topics to Home Assistant
### Current MQTT Topic List
- /home/inside/temperature
- /home/outside/temperature
- /home/outside/humidity
- /home/outside/temperature_deck
- /home/inside/temperature_bedroom
- /home/inside/humidity_bedroom
- /home/inside/temperature_living_room
- /home/inside/humidity_living_room

### Example configuration.yaml
```
